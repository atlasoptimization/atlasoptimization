Hello everybody,

the repositories associated to this profile are dedicated to making mathematical optimization more accessible. Those repositories investigate and showcase ways to use classical optimization methods like linear, semidefinite, stochastic, mixed integer, and dynamic pogramming for real world applications. The goal is to offer 
  - an easy drag and drop interface for optimization problems
  - solutions to typical problems from optimal design, optimal estimation, optimal control
  - easy integration of optimization into production and planning processes 
  
The code is mostly in Python and employs open source solvers. Feel free to contribute and improve the impact powerful and free optimization has on everyday life!

Personally my background is in Hilbert spaces and stochastic modelling but lately I am increasingly employing methods from operations research and I am looking to expand my knowledge of combinatorial optimizaton techniques. You can contact me at jemil.butt@atlasoptimization.ch.

All the best, Jemil
